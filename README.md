# Render Data from Multiple Salesforce Orgs

This art of the possible  demo LWC component displays to an end-user the experience of all the various upcoming opportunities, cases and activities across the different orgs their account/person has. The demo is derived off a real endpoint web service that taps into 4 other orgs, specifically a Mule API that fetches records from each org and consolidate data for rendering.

There is also an option to demo using mock/dummy data if for some reason you don't want to pull actual data from the Salesforce orgs via APIs. 

This repo is part of a series of one-feature Salesforce platform demos.
